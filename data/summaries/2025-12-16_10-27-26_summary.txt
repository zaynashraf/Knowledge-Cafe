Scientists discovered that lowering a specific molecule helps microglia switch into a protective state that quiets brain inflammation in Alzheimer's. When a key signal is removed from them, Alzheimer’s symptoms worsen. This pathway may help explain why some people naturally have reduced Alzheimer's risk. It may also explain how some people have reduced their risk of developing the disease in the first place. The study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
