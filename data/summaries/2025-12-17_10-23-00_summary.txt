Long-term imaging and plasma data show that obese individuals experience much faster increases in proteins linked to neurodegeneration and amyloid buildup. Surprisingly, blood tests detected these changes earlier than PET scans. The results point to obesity as a major, modifiable contributor to Alzheimer’s progression. The study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Conditions, published by the American Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Experimental Biology.
