Time and space are the two fundamental resources of computation. Algorithms require a roughly proportional amount of space to runtime. Researchers long assumed there was no way to achieve anything better. In a stunner of a result &mdash; &ldquo;the best thing in 50 years,&rdquo;" we've found a way to use both time and space in a way that is more efficient than ever. We'll publish the results in an upcoming issue of the journal Computer Science & Engineering International (CSEI), and share them with the rest of the world.
