Quanta staff writer Charlie Wood got seasick aboard a ferry full of physicists on the North Sea. Wood and hundreds of the world&rsquo;s top quantum researchers were en route to Helgoland, the island birthplace of quantum mechanics. The trip was part of a historic conference to mark the theory and practice of quantum mechanical systems. Wood: "My favorite moment of the year in physics happened on a ferry in the North sea. I was seasick. I couldn't breathe." The ferry was headed to the island of Helgeland, where quantum mechanics was first developed.
