Despite centuries of trying, the term ‘religion’ has proven impossible to define. Then why does it remain so necessary? Kwame Anthony Appiah: Religion is not a religion, it is a way of life. He asks: Why is it so important to be a part of a religion that is supposed to be free of sin? Appiah on Aeon: ‘Religion is not just a religion. It’s a way to life.’ He adds: � ‘I’m not a religious person, I am a human being. I want to live my life in a way that is free from sin. I don’t want to be defined by religion.”
