Scientists discovered that lowering a specific molecule helps microglia switch into a protective state that quiets brain inflammation in Alzheimer’s. A small group of these cells seems to have an outsized ability to keep the brain healthier. When a key signal is removed from them, Alzheimer’s symptoms worsen. This pathway may help explain why some people naturally have reduced Alzheimer’s risk.
